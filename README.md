# Sentinels of the Multiverse Mod Development

## Heroes
**Moonwolf** - Chosen of Luna

This hero offers a take on the Urban Fantasy/Supernatual Romance Protagonist.
This character was created and printed for the tabletop version of Sentinels, and 
has seen numerous play sessions.  Card Art is stolen/edited from google image search.
Thanks Google!
Power level is targeted to be comparable to Young Legacy (so pretty strong),
while mechanically very simple.

Status:
* Cards - Complete
* Tests - Complete
* Decklist - Complete
* Art - Card Art Complete

Open Items:
* Character Art - Since this wasn't part of the original paper deck this is currently out of scope,
but I'll likely see if I can't find something to use as a thematic placeholder.
* Balance and Play - Gameplay feedback is welcome, though may not be acted on.
In particular the ratio of Ongoings, One-shots, and Token effects has gone through numerous tweaks.
Well thought out feedback is welcome.


## Installation
Eventually Mods will be able to be downloaded via the Steam Workshop.
Currently mods can be installed manually by creating a `mods` folder in your SotM Stream folder.
By default, that path will be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Sentinels of the Multiverse`
Create a `mods\SotmWorkshopMoonwolf` folder, and extract the Release zip file into the folder.

It should look like this:

    \SotmWorkshopMoonwolf
        manifest.json
        SotmWorkshop.Moonwolf.dll

The art files are too large to include in a release file, but can be downloaded separately from the Assets folder and placed in the mod folder like below.

    \SotmWorkshopMoonwolf
       Atlas
       LargeCardTextures
       manifest.json
       SotmWorkshop.Moonwolf.dll
